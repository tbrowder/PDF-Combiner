=head1 NAME

B<PDF::Combiner> - Provides routines and a program to combine and title PDF documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS
=begin code :lang<raku>
use PDF::Combiner;
combine-pdfs config=our-israel-tour.txt
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PDF::Combiner> is a simple but useful tool to combine PDF documents
into a single PDF document.

In the example above, B<our-israel-tour.txt> is a simple formatted
text file containing several types of lines. See the example project
C<config> files in directory C</example-project> for usable examples
of the input file.

Note the PDF files are expected to be in the same directory as
the project file. If that is a problem for your use case,
please file an issue.

=head1 C<config> file

The configuration (or project) file is a typical text file with
data in single-line format for most options or in
blocks of text. Its suffix is not specified, but
the example files have extensions of C<.txt>
(the author's preference). Options are entered
in a format taken from Rakudoc: C<=option-name value....>
or C<=begin option-name>...C<=end option-name>..

Blank lines are ignored (except in text blocks)
and comments on a line begin at the first C<#> character
and continue to the end of the line.

Note comments in a text block resulting in a blank line
will result in that blank line being retained in
the block.

=head2 Options

=begin item
C<=begin title>...C<=end title>

The lines between the begin/end options
are used to populate a cover with
the first line being the title and the
following lines shown below it after some
blank lines.

Note no cover is produced without this text
block, nor is any cover produced if B<all> 
lines are blank.
=end item

=begin item
C<=numbers>  value?

The 'value' is optional. 
Without it, the result is C<True> if the option alone is present.
If the option is B<not> present, the result is C<False>.
If the 'value' is present, it is evaluated for truthiness.

A true value 
currently produces page numbers on each page
(except any cover which is number one but not 
shown); format: 'Page N of M'.
=end item

=begin item
C<=two-sided> value?

The 'value' is optional. 
Without it, the result is C<True> if the option alone is present.
If the option is B<not> present, the result is C<False>.
If the 'value' is present, it is evaluated for truthiness.

=end item

=begin item
C<=back> value?

The 'value' is optional. 
Without it, the result is C<True> if the option alone is present.
If the option is B<not> present, the result is C<False>.
If the 'value' is present, it is evaluated for truthiness.

=end item

=begin item
C<=outfile> value!

The option and 'value' are required.

It is the file name of the new document which
should have no spaces and have a suffix of C<.pdf>.

=end item

=begin item
C<=paper> value!    

The option is B<not> required.
But if it is used, then 'value' is required.

'value' defines the paper size. Current choices are
'Letter' or 'A4'. If the option is
not used, the default size is 'Letter'.
=end item

=head1 Possible additional options

=begin item
C<=begin introduction>...C<=end introduction>
=end item
