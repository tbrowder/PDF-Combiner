FROM: Thomas M. Browder, Jr. (aka @tbrowder)
SUBJ: Nomination for the ? Award
TO:   Raku Steering Council

I hereby nominate David Warring (@dwarrring) for the Raku ?
award. Although David has not been active on IRC (i think it’s because
he lives in Australia), he has been active on the Perl6 mailing list
since the beginning (and coming to Raku as a very active Perl
contributor). This morning went through my gmail stash and created a
label for PDF and David. My first contact with him was in 2015 and my
most recent was today.

He is a leading Raku module publisher, and his work is huge—mostly
covering Raku APIs for the 1000+ pages of the PDF ISO standard as well
as the HarfBuzz and FreeFont C/C++ libraries. But he also contributed
significant PRs and bug reports to Rakudo in its early, formative
years.

He is always quick to respond to my questions, and is obviously
patient and kind. His depth of knowledge of Raku is readily seen after
only a brief survey of his libraries.

Checking my email labels with David as the main respondent or PR
submitter or bug reporter I get a total of over 20 since April 2015.
